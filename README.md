# YouTube video text summarizer
The text from YouTube videos is transcribed using OpenAI's Whisper model, then processed by a simple custom NLP model to generate a concise summary. \

\
By default, Whisper runs on the CPU, but this can be changed to GPU if your graphics card supports CUDA by using `AudioProcessor(device="your CUDA device")`. \
\
**! PyTorch with CUDA support is not installed via requirements.txt !** \
\
[Go here](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) to install PyTorch with CUDA 12.8 support.
### üìã Verbose
Use `verbose=True` in `AudioProcessor()` and `TextSummarizer()` to get more information. \
